## Hi! I'm Etienne

Currently building Digital Twins tools at Prevu3D. Previously building [Virtual Production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn-QU4iGbw0) tools at Unity, at the crossroads of gaming and film. Before that,
Lead Unity and R&D Developer at [Dpt](https://dpt.co/en/). My interests are in Computer Graphics, Generative and Procedural Systems, Audio Programming,
Tools Making, Artificial Intelligence... Self taught, curious, always eager to learn.

You can also check my [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/user29307828) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiuT9t87PFXYyD41Tkn0q6w) for some (old-ish) experiments.

# Personal Projects

* [CUDA-Photogrammetry-Rotation-Estimation](https://github.com/etienne-p/CUDA-Photogrammetry-Rotation-Estimation) | Estimation of the rotation of a geometric dataset based on its normals. Implemented using CUDA.
* [ofxPolygonTriangulation](https://github.com/etienne-p/ofxPolygonTriangulation) | an OpenFrameworks addon for Computational Geometry in C++.
* [UnityGaussianMixtureModel](https://github.com/etienne-p/UnityGaussianMixtureModel) | An implementation of a Gaussian Mixture Model (Machine Learning Clustering technique) in Unity using Compute Shaders.
* [UnityMorphologicalAntialiasing](https://github.com/etienne-p/UnityMorphologicalAntialiasing) | An implementation of Morphological Antialiasing for Unity's Universal Render Pipeline.

## Visual

* [UnityParticleGalaxyGPGPU](https://github.com/etienne-p/UnityParticleGalaxyGPGPU) | A galaxy particle system running on the GPU, made with Unity.
* [UnityOcean](https://github.com/etienne-p/UnityOcean) | Ocean procedural modelisation, made with Unity.
